# Static and Dynamic Analysis, Code Review for Java based Web Application

- Identified and exploited multiple vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, Broken access control,
Credential Harvesting, and Clickjacking, resulting in a 50% reduction in potential security threats to the web
application.
- Conducted comprehensive manual testing to detect and patch injection vulnerabilities such as SQL, XSS, Command
Injection, Path manipulation, Log forgery/Injection, SMTP using Security Enhanced API, and Xpath query. This
resulted in a 75% decrease in potential security risks for the web application.
- Utilized OWASP ZAP to conduct automated testing and discovered 10 unique vulnerabilities.
- Classified the results from OWASP ZAP into True positives, False positives, and False negativess, resulting in a 60%
reduction in potential security threats for the Tunestore web application.

# Endpoint Detection, DNS, Net Flow Analysis using Elastic SIEM and Python

- Utilized Kibana to analyze login activities and identified compromised machines through pass-the-hash technique,
resulting in the identification of 5 compromised machines and the removal of the backdoor installed by the
attacker, improving the overall security of the network.
- Performed log enrichment for a given dataset and ingested it into Elastic SIEM, enabling the identification of
potential data exfiltration to C2 servers.
- Tools: ELK Stack, Kibana, Python, Jupyter Notebook

# Machine Learning Classification Program to Train and Evaluate Phishing Emails Dataset

- Used Logistic Regression Classifier with 33% data as testing, the rest as training data and analyzed the important
features in the dataset.
- Used Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees and 33% data as testing, the rest as training data to analyze the
important features.
- Used Neural Network Classifier with 33% data as testing, the rest as training data and maximum iteration of 200
leading to Neural Network Convergence.
- Generated the ROC curves and applied 10-fold cross-validation for Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier
and Neural Network classification algorithms to analyze the best algorithm.
- Applied Min-Max Normalization to the important features and re-evaluated classification results for the dataset
using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier algorithms.

# Malware Analysis

- Used Basic and Advanced Static Analysis tools like tools like PEiD, UPX, PEview, CFF Explorer, Strings, Dependency
Walker, Resource Hacker, IDA Pro and Ghidra to analyze the given malware.
- Used Basic and Advanced Dynamic Analysis tools like Process Explorer, Process Monitor, Regshot, ApateDNS,
Wireshark, Netcat, iNetSim and OllyDbg to analyze the given malware.
- Documented the findings and behavior of the analyzed malware based on the analysis result.

# Competitive Cyber Defense

- Designed and implemented single-sign-on services for an enterprise network, including master and slave DNS
servers, an LDAP directory service, and a Kerberos service.
- Implemented network security measures such as DNSSEC and TLS certificates to protect network communications.
- Developed a firewall policy to restrict access to specific ports and redirect incoming requests to designated
servers.
- Deployed a network access control (NAC) solution to an existing network, enhancing overall security.
- Created a new SELinux policy module to control application access, ensuring compliance with security policies.
- Carried out a comprehensive evaluation of a companyâ€™s network architecture and redesigned it to eliminate
potential security breaches.
